# Project Proposal - EDM Genre Classification

I will use the Spotify API to obtain audio features about a variety of EDM songs. I will obtain these songs semi-manually by finding user-generated playlists that organize songs by EDM subgenres (e.g. House, Dubstep, Drum'n'Bass, etc.). I will use the Spotify API to pull the audio features for a large dataset, and the target will be based on the playlist titles. For example, I will assume that the user who created the "Top Dubstep Classics" playlist has appropriately included only Dubstep songs. This is a known limitation to the project, but it is the quickest way to obtain a large dataset of EDM songs. I will build a classification model that can accept the audio features of a new song and predict the EDM subgenre of that song. The final output of the project will be a web application that provides interesting subgenre information given user input.
